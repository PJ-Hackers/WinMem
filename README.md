# 🧠 Windows Memory Viewer & Editor with Subprocess Tree

This is a powerful GUI-based memory inspection and editing tool for **Windows**, built using **Python** and **Tkinter**. It enables users to:

- Browse and inspect running processes (in a hierarchical tree with subprocesses).
- View memory regions of any selected process.
- Read and visualize memory in a hex editor format.
- Edit memory contents (if permissions allow).
- Terminate processes directly from the UI.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This tool requires **Administrator** privileges to access memory of certain processes.

## 🔧 Features

- 🎯 **Process Explorer**: Displays all system processes in a hierarchical tree structure, including their start time and PID.
- 🔍 **Search & Filter**: Search for processes by name or PID.
- 📁 **Memory Region Viewer**: Browse committed memory regions with read/write permissions.
- 🔓 **Hex Viewer/Editor**: Read and optionally edit memory pages (256 bytes at a time).
- 🔪 **Process Terminator**: Safely terminate selected processes.
- ⚡ **Responsive UI**: Background threads prevent freezing during heavy tasks like process or memory enumeration.
